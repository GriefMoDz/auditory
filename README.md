# Auditory
Adds a little audio visualizer to the bottom left of the Discord window where the user modal is. Features a large amount of customization and captures audio from your main output device (meaning it works *anywhere* on your computer).

This screenshot doesn't show off a lot (the modal changes color and flashes slightly), so you can see a video of it working [here](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/mP75BlLd.mp4).
It's worth noting that you're able to change a lot of the options in the visualizer, including brightness if you feel like it's too distracting/bright, and the color of the visualizer.
